This is because people rank their new commitments in their list of priorities, and if they perceive a new community as not worth their time early on, itll end up in the bottom of that list, leading them to become disengaged members.This is why when planning our new member social for REACH at Penn, my VP of Community, Kelly Nguyen, and I needed to think of a banger. Something that would set a good precedent for the year and make members go, Wow, that was sick as hell (in a non-corny way). We juggled around with ideas like Skyzone, Topgolf, and Escape Rooms. But after a bit of bashing our head against the wall, we arrived at Goat Yoga. It was an activity most organizations on campus don't typically offer, and it allowed us to tap into one of humanitys greatest weaknesses: cute baby animals.The only challenge was negotiating a budget-friendly rate for 30+ people, so we proposed taking professional photos in exchange for a discount (it paid to run a social media club).We hosted goat yoga this past weekend, and I think the event was a hit! Lots of posts were made that day and the goats peeing on our mats brought us ever so closer together . "}]}

Now, I believe Instagram has way higher utility and growth potential for creators than TikTok for three main reasons.To better explain the three advantages Ive observed, Ill analyze one of the creators Ive really looked up to on Instagram, @filmwcolleen, an Instagram creator who makes cinematic, thought-provoking content about her life:1. Instagram is better for building a community. Instagram stories and DMs are used by almost every user, allowing creators to interact more casually with their audience. I see Colleen constantly reposting her audiences reposts, sharing parts of her day, and asking questions to her audience. This allowed me to get to know her better as a person since I see snippets of her life outside of the highly produced videos she makes.2. You OWN your audience on Instagram. When talking to my friend, Katie Xu, she told me the key difference between Instagram and TikTok is that you have to earn your audience every time on TikTok, while on Instagram, you only have to earn your audience once. And after looking at Colleens Instagram and TikTok, this made a lot of sense. Colleen is constantly bringing in over 100k+ views on almost every video she posts, whereas on TikTok, it hovers around 1,000 views. Her intros on Instagram dont follow the usual hook your audience in right away format right away, and because shes already earned her audience on Instagram, she has a very strong baseline of viewership.3. Instagram is more conducive to hypergrowth. Even though Instagram is older than TikTok, the legitimacy of short-form has only recently started coming to fruition. When looking at Colleens following, shes grown 190k followers on Instagram in just a few months and 3k on TikTok.Even though numbers arent everything and theres obviously a lot of external factors at play, it's still interesting to see how much Instagram has been evolving as a strong contender of short-form platforms.

The board and I conducted a competitive application cycle in September and welcomed 33 new members to the club (44 total members, including our board).2. We're consulting three high-growth startups to help them build their go-to-market strategy and even helping one of them build out an ambassadorship program. And all these projects are being led by our FANTASTIC project leads, Olivia Yun, Rachel Ker, and Sarah Kim. 3. We added an exuberant freshman representative, Jean Park, to our board to be a liaison for the freshmen and do all the work that the board didn't want to do...4. We've had three separate guest speaker talks at our general meetings with various student content creators like Asher Lieberman, Andrew Yu, and Mino Lee. 5. We've hosted an exorbitant number of socials, with one of our favorites being an overnight REACHtreat  to Atlantic City by the beach. I'm actually proudest of our socials because we've been able to build a pretty solid community (hopefully, everyone feels the same).The board and I have accomplished a lot this semester, and we plan on doing more! I'll be updating LinkedIn with what we're up to in the future! Special shoutouts to Allen Yao, Ashley Lin, Anne-Christie Duvert, Channing Ware, Madeline Murillo, Corey He, and Kelly Nguyen for being a somewhat decent board."}]}

Led by Sarah Kim, weve been working on developing growth strategies for Pillar to acquire new users. For some context, Pillar is a link-in-bio software that allows creators to monetize their platform and pitch themselves through their digital media kits.One of the things our team realized for Pillar was that the best way to acquire new users is to provide as much unconditional value as possible to potential users. After all, if the unconditional value is what people get for not even paying for the software, it would frame how much they could get if they did end up paying. Also, it was great for building more awareness around the product.So, in order to provide this unconditional value to reach as many creators as possible, well be hosting a webinar about how to scale as a creator with some amazing guest speakers with the headline speaker being Mino Lee (@minolee.mp4) followed by Zachery (@mdmotivator), Erica (EVP @ Onefluent), and Catherine Grace OConnell (CEO at MODLife Media).I can vouch from personally knowing Mino that hes one of the smartest and most authentic creators on the internet. Hes publicly building his business and amassed over 100k followers in the last 3 months on Instagram by posting daily.So if youre a creator interested in learning to scale your following and better monetize your platform, make sure to sign-up!"}]}

Most members didnt want to pursue content creation full-time. Many of our members still want to go into banking, consulting, and other traditional industries that require a much cleaner digital footprint than the creator economy. 2. It was hard to motivate members to create content consistently. We ran a creator camp program for 4 weeks in the 1st semester where we were supposed to hold each other accountable for uploading one video a week. By the end, only 2/10 people had stayed consistent because it just wasn't their priority.3. There was no vision for what content to make. Considering most members dont want to go into content creation full-time, there wasnt a clear path for people to make a video, make it better, and repeat that cycle. However, despite these problems, there was still a high demand for members who said, I really want to start making content.So in order to combat the pitfalls of the first semester, we formed a content creation committee with 14 members, created @unfilter.edu to be a digital media brand that would be run by them, and appointed a new VP, Carson Wang, to head this initiative. Weve found that working together to build this brand has been way more effective in getting people to make content than our attempts last semester. Everyone is consistently given clear direction and deadlines to meet every week at their meetings, and the collaborative environment of this channel makes it so no one can fall too behind even if a week is missed.So far, we've mainly been experimenting with posting content that has viral potential like trivia, man-on-the-street interviews, and house tours. The vision is to grow and operate the brand similarly to Jubilee and The Cut. Were definitely far from this goal, but with this semester alone, weve gained over 6,800+ followers on Instagram and 1,200+ followers on TikTok with a few of our videos hitting over 4m+ views already!And I just have to shout out Carson again for doing such an amazing job with this committee. It takes a true leader and operator to manage 14 people and make sure everyones on the same page, especially considering most members had 0 prior content experience! He runs a tight ship and Im super excited to see where it goes.If you have any suggestions or thoughts for where we could take this, Id love to know! This idea is still super new and were always open to pivoting whenever something new works."}]}

Like if youre staying overnight in the woods with no wi-fi, you have no option but to talk to get closer to the people around you. Even though our location was really nice, planning to get to the middle-of-nowhere with 25 people came with a lot of challenges. One, none of us had cars. Two, there were no grocery stores nearby. And three, we had to plan activities accordingly.Luckily, this was all ironed out together with my VP of Community, Kelly Nguyen, and Sarah Kim, our lovely senior, stepped up and led our meal prep with the new members. It mightve been the McKinsey in her, but she ran that kitchen like a drill sergeant, and I had never seen a more seamless work unit in my life.Some of our activities included hide and seek in the dark, cooking s'mores by the campfire, and playing our traditional hot seat game where every member gets on the hotseat for two minutes and everyone whatever questions come to mind.So, overall great time, and would highly recommend any college orgs to host one as well if youre looking to build community amongst your members."}]}

The fact that he started in banking, then attended Harvard Law, and transitioned into social media isn't necessarily relatable (most of us are not going to Harvard Law ), but it definitely resonated, as it taught us that you don't need to have it all figured out right out of college.Sam also had a lit dinner with some of us right before the talk, where he shared his wisdom in a more intimate setting.Thank you so much for coming out, Sam!"}]}

I honestly wasnt expecting much, but there I met so many great people and found my third place, which are places where you can interact with people outside of your work and home. One of the people I met, Brandon, even gave me his old pair of climbing shoes so I could climb when I came back to Philadelphia.Even during my Spring Break trip to Italy, during my two trips to a rock climbing gym, I met more people there than during the entire trip. I got plenty of food recs, had a chat about their opinion on the US (it wasnt too positive), and tried solving a few difficult climbs together.Theres just something unifying about a bunch of people throwing themselves at a wall that bonds people together.If youve moved into a new city or want to meet new people, even if youre a complete beginner, Id highly recommend checking out a rock climbing gym."}]}

Can my mom view it? 2. Can my mom create with it? 3. Is there a reason for my mom to come back to it tomorrow? If a new technology can answer yes to all 3 of these questions, then it most likely means it has broad appeal and staying power. For example, I see generative AI being very applicable to my mom even though she rarely even uses the internet. She might want to generate videos of my handsome son roaming the streets of Italy, if she misses seeing me everyday.Paul also mentioned how in order for every social media platform to be sustainable, it needs to have a business model that enables a creator to make money. He specifically said, Since every creator needs to put food on the table, it doesnt make sense for a creator to make content on a platform that wont pay them. This is something I wanted to ask him about since Instagram doesnt have a monetization program. I wondered what their plan was to better incentivize creators to come on their platform considering creators dont get paid (maybe a question for next time).One of the things I noticed about great guest speakers is they like to engage the audience with questions, and Paul was a natural at doing this. He asked, Whats a trend youve posted about recently, and people were literally pulling up audios and playing it live. Definitely got people reengaged whenever he transitioned topics.Thanks to Corey He for coordinating all the travel accommodations, and thank you again for coming out and eating with us, Paul!"}]}
