So I did. I woke up the next morning with a bad gut feeling. I immediately packed my bags on a whim as fast as I could. I called my mom and booked a flight back to my mom's house while I was in the Lyft to the airport. It's been 3 weeks since then, I'm back in New York, and I've never felt so free.

Focusing on my skincare, haircare, fashion style, and beauty routine to feel more badass and confident in myself.

I make sure reminders pop up 1 day before, 30 minutes before, and 5 minutes before an event or task has to happen. 3 hours at the gym? Put it on GC. 2 hours of deep work for classes? Put it on GC. 1 hour of content creation? Put it on GC. How I manage designs, manifestations, and marketing: Figma I design everything on Figma. My LinkedIn posts, banners, marketing materials, business cards, media kits, presentations, mobile apps, websites, and more. But even more than that, I also create vision boards at the beginning of each year to manifest my biggest goals of that year. I look back at them at the end of the year, and I always end up achieving those goals. How I manage my aspirations, entertainment, and affirmations: YouTube I'm big on daily affirmations. Every morning, I listen to a 10 minute to 1 hour video of daily affirmations about money, fame, or success. During these videos, they give me affirmations to say and I repeat. These include: Money flows to me with ease, or My social media accounts are growing rapidly, or I achieve everything I desire.  How I manage my mood, confidence, and feelings: Spotify If I'm feeling sad, I want to fully process that emotion. I never hold back. I will listen to a 2 hour sad playlist and fully release the tears until I feel relaxed. If I'm feeling like a girlboss, I want to fully validate that emotion too. I will listen to my, gym girlboss goddess or lucky girl syndrome playlist. You can follow my Spotify profile here: https://lnkd.in/ejay9WZc  How I manage my curiosity, questions, and skincare: TikTok Gone are the days where I search things on Google. I use TikTok as my search engine. Unlike Google, I get to hear real people's experiences, stories, and testimonials, rather than top 10 tips articles on Google that have affiliate marketing and ads plastered all over them. I started taking care of my skin because of TikTok. I started finding the best skincare, makeup, and haircare products because of this app. I started understanding the best form for lifting at the gym because of this app. How do you organize your life?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "HOT TAKE: Be an idealist, not a realist."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ever heard of the saying, Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars by Norman Vincent Peale? Well it's true. And it's because being an idealist has led me to secure... 3 Microsoft internships. 40k+ followers across LinkedIn and Instagram. Thousands of dollars in revenue in my online business. And lots of influencer brand deals on LinkedIn and Instagram. Of course, idealism has to be paired with actionable steps and implementation in order to properly work. I wanted to be internet famous, so I started posting on LinkedIn and Instagram consistently. I wanted to intern at Big Tech, so I learned multiple coding languages, entered hackathons, and built personal projects. I wanted to land brand deals, so I searched on TikTok and Instagram for influencer pitch templates and brand email lists. So here's how you can combine idealism with implementation to achieve your career goals in 2024: Make a vision board. I design a collage of Pinterest pictures that represent my goals for every year using Figma. At the end of each year, I look back at the vision board, and I always achieve the goals I listed on the board. You can do the same. Stop saying “what if” and start saying “I will” while taking action. “What if I don't have experience” and “what if people judge me” are common excuses I hear when students message me on LinkedIn about being lost on how to achieve their goals. There is no such thing as “what if.” You either WILL do it or WON'T do it. Write a letter to your future self every month. I've written letters to my future self periodically ever since I was 14 years old. They either have my goals for the next 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months, or even 5 years. I always read them later and realize I've achieved even greater than what my past self asked me to achieve. P.S. Want to land your dream internship at a Big Tech company?

So today, I made a bet with the king himself, Jimmy Donaldson. I sent this email to his team, including the incredible Reed Duchscher, Night, MrBeast a few minutes ago.

Building a personal brand is so underrated. It leads you to so many opportunities and people who you never would have met if you didn't post every day. Many people say, OMG I want to post this and that. And they never go through with it. Why? 1. Because they are scared of being judged. 2. Because they think it's not the right time to start. 3. Because they think they are too busy to post consistently. How do I know this? Because I used to feel the same way. But the reality is... ...these are just excuses. And here are each of the excuses, debunked. 1. Not everyone will like your content. Some people will love it. Some people will hate it. So post anyway. 2. The day that you are ready to start will never come if you don't start immediately. You're just delaying your success. 3. If something is important, you will make time for it. If you can scroll on social media for hours, you can take less than 10 minutes of your day to make a social media post. Every single day that you don't share your value and voice on LinkedIn is a another opportunity you are missing out on. Just post, sis (or bro). P.S.

Some days I was in-person, some days I was remote, some days I worked half in-person and half remote. There's usually meetings, 1:1 calls, spec writing, customer calls, user research, design, and/or code. What was the culture like? Super friendly, welcoming, and helpful! Everyone was willing to help, be an informal mentor, and do a 1:1 call with you if you asked. What did you like the most about it? I loved being in the Puget sound area for the first time and hanging out with my new intern friends. I went hiking, kayaking, traveling, concert-going, food-tasting, shopping, dancing, and so much more! What were the challenges? This was my first time traveling across the country to live alone.

I have more time to take care of my mental and physical health. I have more time to invest in the recruiting season. I have more time to work on my online business. I have more time to travel and network. With WGU, I'm on track to graduate 1 year earlier than I would've been if I had stayed at a traditional brick and mortar school.

End of 2023: Happiest I've been, acing classes, landed a dream Microsoft internship, posting content everyday to 35k+ followers across LinkedIn and Instagram. I still remember when I would get out of bed everyday feeling like a forever failure. I still remember when I would go to sleep feeling like I would never achieve my dreams of being a content creator. I still remember when I would do my exams feeling like this would never amount to anything. But on the first day of my Microsoft internship in May 2023, everything changed. I had to learn how to live independently for the first time. I had to learn how to talk to people who are smarter, more confident, and more experienced than me. I had to learn how to adapt to a big corporate environment. Looking back... I can confidently say that Microsoft improved my life when I was struggling the most. However, you don't need a whole year, a Big Tech internship, and a flight across the country to recover from burnout like I did. Here's how you can recover from burnout in 3 steps: Take care of your physical health. Lift at the gym 3 times a week, have a nightly skincare routine, and cook healthy foods at home. Don't always feel like you have to be productive. Go shopping. Go take a dance class. Go out to the salon. Treat yourself. You don;'t need to be working 24/7 to be successful. Get rid of things and people that drain you. Surround yourself with people and activities who boost your energy, confidence, and self-esteem. Cut off the rest that don't. P.S.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I work in tech, but I hate coding."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Freshman year of college, almost everyone told me I should learn how to code. So I did. I won hackathons. I grinded personal coding projects. I landed software engineering internships. But despite what everyone told me… I secretly always HATED it. You see… Growing up, I was known as the creative, art kid. And never the logical, go-to math-genius kid. Deep down, I've always wanted to be an “artist” and a “content creator.” …but I chose to listen to other people, while ignoring my own gut instinct. …and I ended up doing something I hated everyday—aka coding—which pulled me away from that dream. But guess what? What I failed to realize is… You actually don't need to code to break into tech. Although I don't code anymore, I'm going to be returning to Microsoft for the third time as a PM Intern. Although I don't code anymore, I have my dream side hustles that make me 4 figures per month. Although I don't code anymore, I am a content creator with 35k+ followers across LinkedIn and Instagram. And I never plan on touching code again. Don't feel pressured to code. Tech needs way more than just software engineers. They need designers, product managers, product marketers, and entrepreneurs too. P.S. Want to land your dream internship at a Big Tech company?

This is what I've been doing to prepare: Staying updated with my team's product. I've been keeping myself updated with Viva Engage product updates through their Microsoft blog and LinkedIn creators. Watching Product Management YouTube videos. Some of my favorite YouTube channels in the product space include Chloe Shih at Discord, Exponent, and Liam Bolling. Competing in hackathons from a PM perspective. I've been applying to hackathons at Stanford University, UCLA, and more. When I compete in these hackathons, I will be the product manager and designer of the team, alongside 3 software developers. Knowing what's going on in the tech world. Newsletters like Morning Brew, TechCrunch, and TLDR are my go-to's for staying updated with the latest tech news, trends, and innovations. Chatting with former Product Manager Interns at Microsoft. I've been hopping on coffee chats with former PM Interns who successfully got a return offer as a full-time Microsoft PM to get their insights on how they did it. P.S.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "This year, I landed 15+ Big Tech Interviews at Microsoft, The Walt Disney Company, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and more Fortune 500 companies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But here's the shocking part... I don't attend an Ivy League or top university. I don't have any family connections who work in tech. I don't always feel like I belong in this industry. When I was rejected from my dream Ivy League universities as a senior in high school, I thought I would never land my dream internships. Little did I know...I was so, so, so wrong. Because the truth is... You don't need a top university, nepotism, or 100% confidence to break into tech. You just need to START. If you keep overthinking and never get started, you'll never land your dream role. I challenge you to simply START the pathway to your dream tech role by doing this: Make an engaging post about your journey, projects, or insight about your relevant field just once a day on LinkedIn. Attend tech conferences like GHC by AnitaB.org, Society of Women Engineers, AFROTECH, and SHPE to do onsite interviews. Go for similar roles at your top company, then pivot later through negotiating the return offer. Build a personal website to showcase relevant projects and case studies using Figma for design, React for code, and Replit for easy hosting. Attend company sponsored hackathons to get internship offers as a prize for winning. 🚀 P.S. Want to land your dream internship at a Big Tech company?
