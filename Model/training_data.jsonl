{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to Create Strong Resume Bullet Points"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cold-applied to 150 internships as a freshman with no referrals and no work experience. Yet, I still managed to land 8 first-round interviews and 3 offers for paid summer internships. I feel like this is sort of a hot take with all of the content on LinkedIn focused around networking [and getting referrals], but like it or not, you still have to have a strong resume to get your foot in the door. More and more companies are putting less and less weight on referrals in an effort to create a more equal playing field, and some companies don't accept referrals for internships AT ALL. So what can you do to better your chances in a sea of ultra-competitive applicants? Make your resume so compelling that the hiring manager has no choice but to give you a shot! One of the best ways to do that is the Google X-Y-Z method. This method is not new or novel; lots of people, especially on LinkedIn, have mentioned or discussed it. But not a lot of people explain exactly how to implement it. So here's how to implement the Google XYZ resume method + real examples I've used! If you want to learn even more about how to craft a compelling resume, I still have 5 spots left open in my 2-hour resume writing masterclass, happening TOMORROW. Reserve your spot here [if the time doesn't work for your schedule, no worries! Register for the class and you'll be sent a recording of the whole class!] The Google XYZ Method: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]. Now let's break it down ~ [X] Start with a past-tense action verb that's appropriate for the experience ex. Achieved, Improved, Launched, Transformed, Designed, Built, etc. [X] Name the task at hand ~ designed a web-based innovation management platfor (design example), built a native iOS mobile application that connected the user (engineering example), led a team to deliver a prototype and pitch deck to define a minimum viable product (product example). [Y] Quantify the impact your accomplishment had ~ ...thereby saving ET $49,000/year on software outsourcing (cost impact), ...pilot for 300+ participants, (customer impact), ...resulted in $8.7k in sales (revenue impact). [Z] Elaborate on how you did the task and what skills it took to do it ~ ...[in order] to define a minimum viable product, demonstrate user flows, and outline product KPIs (product example), to test the efficacy of process by evaluating a previously-identified efficiency opportunity against the process (process engineering example).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I turn 21 today!!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Last year, on my birthday, I started a tradition of posting X number [birthday] lessons I've learned from X year. Last year, it was 20 lessons, so this year, I'm continuing the tradition with 21!!! But I'm adding a twist this year! This whole week, I will be posting 21-themed things, and I'm gonna get real personal [along with the regular content, of course]. So here are 21 lessons I've learned from year 21: 5 Things I have learned about Time, Maturity, and getting older. (1) Make more time for the people who want to pour into you. (2) You have to protect your time & your peace because no one else will. (3) Be picky & intentional with who you spend your time with & how you spend it. (4) Maturing is realizing what you're actually worth and enforcing that worth. (5) Getting older is appreciating the mundane things like 9 hours of sleep, home-cooked healthy meals, and being able to spend >30 min in the gym. 5 Things I have learned about people from people (1) People are generally more forgiving and nicer than you assume. (2) Time & distance don't necessarily matter when it's the right people. (Translation: I love my LinkedIn/internet besties!!] (3) The right partner can make all the difference. (4) Having & craving a smaller circle is perfectly normal and okay. (5) You don't have to deal with toxic people. Fk 'em. 5 Things I have learned about life (1) Decisions aren't permanent. You can change your mind and pivot. (2) Pave your own path. Your journey & timeline are yours and yours alone. (3) You HAVE to get really uncomfortable if you want to improve. (4) Things/situations are only as stressful as YOU make them. (5) You will outgrow things, places, and people, and that's okay. 5 Things I have learned about myself #21 (1) My three non-negotiables [with opportunities] are ethics, passion & compensation (feeling valued). (2) Being impulsive or going with your gut isn't always a bad thing. (3) I am NOT superhuman, and I should probably be more forgiving of myself. (4) Value isn't just what you have to give or offer, it's also who YOU are. (5) I will always follow through on a commitment or a promise, even when it makes me feel like st. (Bonus #21) I don't hold grudges, but if you burn a bridge with me, don't ask me for career help, clout, collabs, or really anything else. I will forgive, but I will never fing forget. That's my 21 lessons for this year, stay tuned for 21 People I'm Grateful for in my LinkedIn Journey, 21 Amazing, Incredible, Exceptional Moments, 21 Hopes, Goals, Dreams for year 22, 21 crazy, way-too-personal stories (newsletter article), and 21 Things I'm Proud of."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "breakdown of the 5 key elements of my resume & why each one is so important"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I wrote a resume that got me SWE intern interviews at TikTok, Accenture, Ford, Analog Devices (ADI), SiriusXM, three offers from startups and offers from Medidata [a Fortune Future 50], SAP, and Disney as a freshman. Here is a breakdown of the 5 key elements of my resume & why each one is so important: Header - email, phone number, LinkedIn link, GitHub link, and portfolio website link. Include your contact info since the hiring team needs to know how to contact you. Include your LinkedIn, GitHub, and portfolio to give the hiring team a comprehensive look at who you are and what makes you perfect for the job. Education - relevant coursework and activities/organizations. Some internships, like Microsoft Explore, require a certain level of coursework (ex. Calculus I, Intro to CS). Other companies may expect you to have completed higher-level coursework, like DSA. Showing involvement in on-campus organizations can show off non-work interests or your dedication to a specific niche (ex. Cybersecurity, Product). Skills - professional skills, software, and programming languages. Almost any job requires you to have the first two, and most tech jobs require all three. Professional skills generally refer to industry- or role-related skills (ex. project management), and software skills refer to software tools you know how to use (ex. Asana, Jira, Confluence). Technical Experience - Notice that I didn't say work experience ~ that's because I didn't have any. I made do with what I had which was my experience at Berkeley's PUF Immersion program, Girls Who Code's SIP, and Kode with Klossy's Web Dev camp. I didn't necessarily have work experience, but I demonstrated both knowledge and applied experience in the area I was trying to break into (SWE). Projects ~ saved the best for last! Projects are not only a way to show off your technical skills but also to show initiative in doing things outside of academics. Two of my projects from my freshman year were an iOS mobile app and a hackathon project that got 2nd place. Want to write a killer resume that gets you offers like mine did?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I did my first startup pitch competition & I got 2nd place!!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "About a week ago, I made a very last-minute decision to enter the 1st annual LaunchNevada Pitch Competition. Yesterday, I was SO nervous . My stomach was in knots for hours beforehand, and I couldn't even get my heart rate down until right before it was my turn to pitch. Nerves aside, I still gave a pitch that I'm pretty proud of and was good enough to get 2nd place (+a $1,000 prize). I watched all of the other pitches, and based on those + mine, here are a few key tips/observations to win/place at a pitch competition: Keep your presentation on time! If you go over your given time limit, it looks like you didn't rehearse, and makes you look unprepared. Plus, there is nothing worse/more embarrassing than getting hard-stopped by the judges halfway through your slides. Keep your deck small. You should be able to convey your concept in <10 slides. The best pitches are typically around 5-6 slides. A good rule of thumb is to make your deck 1/2 as many slides as you have minutes [10 minutes = 5 slides]. 3 Observe other pitches if you can. You can't always control the order in which you go; I went 10th out of 11 last night, and that was by luck of the draw [literally, we drew numbers]. But if you pay attention to the other pitches, you can learn from their mistakes and even pre-empt the types of questions the judges might ask. 4 BFFR ~ Be realistic w/ your numbers [market size, projections, etc.]. No judge wants to see that you have an idea for a local coffee shop and claim to have a $150B total addressable market. In addition, no judge wants to see you have $10M revenue projections in your first year when you don't even have a flushed-out product. The Q&A is everything. TBH, I think pitch competition scoring is heavily influenced by how the pitcher handles the Q&A. The judges will ask about things that you didn't cover in your presentation or try to poke holes in it. Q&A Hack: If you have a large deck you can't get through in your time limit, keep the additional slides after your conclusion slide as Appenices and refer to them as needed in your Q&A. It's okay to admit you don't know or don't have an answer. The worst mistake I saw someone make in their Q&A was to try to give a BS answer about a technical topic that was not their core competency. Don't try to smoke & mirror the judges; they will call you on your BS. Overall, this was a fun and fantastic learning experience! Special thanks to the University of Nevada, Reno College of Business for organizing this event, thank you to the judges (Matt Westfield, Chris Yount, Dawson Lamb) for taking the time to listen to our pitches and give us feedback, and thank you to my support group/fan club (boyfriend, Parker + one of my besties, Kayla) for coming to cheer me on.

I spent about 30 hours per week on my internship hunt while being a full-time student. I took 35 credits my first year, and applying to jobs was basically my full-time job, on top of being a [more than] full-time student. I was losing sleep, sacrificing free time, and, worst of all, my mental health was at an all-time low. I was so anxious from constantly getting ghosted and incredibly stressed from trying to balance school and job searching. I even sustained a concussion during my internship hunt, and the doctor told me I couldn't do any 'brain-heavy' activity for three days. All I could think was, I'm missing out on 30+ job applications (10+ per day). That is NOT healthy and, in no way, normal, especially for an 18-year-old. You can imagine that, as a senior in college, it's even harder. I'm still working, taking 15 credits, starting a senior capstone project, AND hunting for full-time jobs. To add to the pressure, for seniors, it's prime recruiting season (Sept-Oct) for top, lucrative full-time jobs, and landing these jobs is incredibly difficult and time-consuming. The difference between freshman me and senior me is that I know better now. You shouldn't have to sacrifice your free time, well-being, or mental health just to get a job.

But I did give a workshop on developing your personal brand to a room full of government IT managers and professionals! Despite the fact I've spoken 35+ times before, this was my first time speaking at a conference! And I was NERVOUS . Typically, my audience is people close to my age (16-24). But this time, my entire audience was older than me, with it mostly being comprised of mid- to senior-level professionals [including a few C-suiters ]. In spite of my nervousness, I made it through, cracked a few jokes, and even taught my audience the Gen Z meaning of flex. Aside from that, my presentation was primarily focused on building a personal brand within your organization [not externally, like on LinkedIn] and how you can use it to advance your career. Here are 5 key takeaways from my presentation ~  Define your brand identity by asking yourself What are the things I want to be known for?If my colleagues could describe me in three words, what would they be?, and What are my 'superpowers?  Become a better communicator by telling stories to portray ideas and understand your audience by empathizing with your listener.  Build quality relationships by going deep instead of wide ~ basically quality > quantity. Use the 33/33/33 rule when networking, and ABPV (Always Be Providing Value).  Seek out professional development opportunities proactively and be prepared when those opportunities come knocking.  Leverage community by joining organizations and groups ~ not only will this help you find people you can build with [accountability buddies, moral support, etc], but it will also show what's important to you [i.e. Society fo Women Engineers, minority BERGs]  Big thank you to GMIS Nevada for having me and to the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa for providing a fantastic venue!

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It still feels a bit surreal, being the youngest mentor of this year's cohort of the gener8tor Reno-Tahoe. This thing really hit me when I found out that one of the founders I'm working with is a tenured professor at my university in the CS department. It was very much an Oh, how the tables have turned moment . But aside from the surrealness of it, it's been an incredible learning experience, even for me as a mentor. I've never considered myself a 'subject matter expert' or 'guru' on really anything. But after the lunch & learn workshop I gave last week, a few of the founders came prepared with questions that really made me think and also made me realize that maybe I do have some helpful tidbits of knowledge. So here are a few of the key takeaways from my mentorship 1:1s for founders related to GTM strategy, marketing, and personal branding ~  Organic growth + influencer marketing > paid ads. When trying to understand your audience, it's going to take a bit of trial and error. You have to figure out what motivates your customers and where they hang out. Growing slowly but organically will help you figure these things out, and influencers are a straight shot to your audience once you do have it figured out.  Building in public, while it may be uncomfortable, will do wonders for your company. IMO, every founder should be building their brand alongside their company, especially since they're not mutually exclusive. Having a personal brand as a founder can help you attract investors, build a community, and even get you sales, especially in the B2B space.  For a B2B founder, the goal is to become the go-to guy/gal, aka a thought leader in your industry/vertical. Whatever space you're building in, you need to position yourself as a thought leader in that space, whether that's FinTech, HealthTech, eCommerce, or anything in between. By becoming the go-to guy/gal in your space, you've already created demand for your expertise and, by proxy, your product.  Stay tuned and hit that post notifications button for more startup/vc content and some snapshots of my journey into this space!  BTW, a few of these startups will be raising in the near future!

I had not taken Data Structures or Algorithms yet.  I didn't even know what LeetCode was ().  I had 0 relevant work experiences to put on my resume. If it isn't abundantly obvious from those facts, I was NOT a standout CS major. I was quite literally just another CS kid at a below-average state school. But I knew I had to be more than that. So, I had to get innovative with my job search strategies. Here are 4 [more] strategies I used to land those internship offers and interviews ~  Apply to lesser-known companies. That doesn't necessarily mean applying to smaller companies or startups. You can apply to companies that aren't necessarily household names but are still great companies. Doing this was how I landed my first summer offer, and the company was a Fortune Future 50 lister.  Optimize your LinkedIn profile for recruiters to find you. It shouldn't be any secret at this point that recruiters use LinkedIn to source talent. Before I even had a following on this platform, I was able to land my first interview offer with a defense contractor AND one of my startup internship offers via them finding my profile.  Attend a career fair and be very intentional with your efforts. This is how I landed 2 of 3 of my startup internship offers. It was purely virtual since it was Spring '21, but I cherry-picked which companies had roles that fit me and booked back-to-back 1-1s with each company.  Use other job boards. I always talk about how awesome LinkedIn Jobs is, BUT there's a lot of competition on LinkedIn, obviously. I decided to use Glassdoor and applied for an internship with another F500 that looked like a good fit. I didn't get the offer, but I did make it to the final round and was the only non-MIT student who'd made it that far LOL.  Want to steal the exact resume I used to help me land these interviews?

Yesterday evening, a few motivated students came to a business classroom on a Friday evening at 5 p.m. (yes, really ) to learn how to write a strong resume no matter where you are in your undergraduate career. Here are 8 key takeaways from my workshop ~  Key sections you need to have on your resume: skills, education, experience, projects, contact information  Some DON'Ts: no home addresses, no photos, avoid putting your grad date if you can [unless you're a junior/senior]  Don't have work experience? Make it about relevant or technical experience from extracurricular activities, clubs, competitions, etc.  Having a projects section/portfolio is crucial when you are a freshman or a sophomore. Use it to show off hard & soft skills and fill in the gaps of your resume.  Showcasing industry- and role-specific skills on a resume is so important (ex. for product management ~ stakeholder management, written communication, agile project management)  You have to have some substance to work with - spend time building (rather than writing) up your resume with project experience, fellowships, competitions, externships, and other experiences  Bullet points 101: use strong action verbs, quantify your achievements/impact, no responsibility-based language, use the Google XYZ method  Use your resume to tell a story by focusing on key skills for the role and selecting cohesive experiences Thank you so much to Kiara Steinhorst for booking me and coordinating my workshop!

Let me make something clear ~ I was NOT an exceptional or what one might see as a standout CS major. My GPA was good, but I had 0 work experience, hadn't taken key CS classes (DSA), and didn't go to a top CS school (ranked #263 by US News at the time). At best, I had one hackathon 2nd place award (we were 2nd place out of 2 in our category LOL) and a handful of projects [again, nothing THAT outstanding]. So, I had to get really creative with my job search strategies. Here are a 4 strategies I used to land the those internship offers and interviews ~  Write a cover letter. Yes, seriously. I had a hiring manager bluntly tell me (in my interview) that she hadn't read my resume yet because she offered me the interview just after reading my cover letter. Her exact words were, You wrote a cover letter... no one does that anymore, and that interview later turned into an offer.  Apply to jobs with 10 or fewer applicants using the LinkedIn filter. This tactic, alone, helped me land four first-round interviews.  Optimize the crap out of your resume. No an ATS is not responsible for you getting auto-rejected, but you still need to make sure an ATS can parse your resume properly. This strategy helped me land the interview at Disney, which ultimately turned into my first internship.  Niche down on what kind of internships you're applying to. After reflecting on my resume, I realized I had a stand-out skill glaring me right in the face: iOS mobile development. I started applying to those internships rather than general SWE. This resulted in me getting four first-round interview offers for this specific type of role. hashtag#internships hashtag#internship hashtag#summerinternship hashtag#earlycareer hashtag#jobsearch"}]}

Thank you so, so much to the gener8tor Reno-Tahoe for inviting me to be an official mentor of this year's accelerator cohort! As an official mentor, I was asked to teach a lunch-and-learn workshop today on how founders can build personal brands and leverage them to get sales, clients, customers, free PR, and even investors! Here are a few key takeaways from my workshop:  When starting out with content creation & personal brand building ~ you don't have to start from scratch. Start with stuff you already know and are familiar with. Build thought leadership upon topics that are relevant to you and your company.  By putting a face & voice to the brand, you can build a loyal community around your startup (a cult following, if you will), foster brand loyalty through transparent and authentic build in public content, and attract investors by showcasing your progress in the startup and as a founder.  Building a personal brand is a way to growth-hack your network, while still maintaining intentionality in your relationships. You could meet fellow builders, partners, clients, investors, or even leverage your brand to get close up and regularly interact with your customers!

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Let's talk about what happened at GHC23."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I attended the annual Grace Hopper Celebration last week, and it was a starkly different experience than I was expecting, to say the least. I attended the conference expecting to find a safe space for women with a week of fun, sisterhood, friendship, and opportunities. While I did get the latter of the two, I certainly did not find a safe space for women. What I saw instead, was thousands of young women and NB technologists being shoved, pushed, harassed, bullied, violated, spoken over, and, above all, discouraged. I was shocked when I heard the Chief Impact Officer of AnitaB.org, at the opening plenary, stating that many male attendees had lied about their gender on their registration and identified themselves as non-binary. Not only is this action a slap in the face to all NB individuals, but it makes it abundantly clear that these individuals did not understand or care about the mission of GHC. These men were not allies, attending a conference to show their support of women in tech. It was the exact opposite. I've heard many sentiments from men in tech, along the lines of When is the celebration for men? or Women would be pissed if there was a conference oriented around men. Well, guess what? It's every day for men. As of 2023, still, only 26.7% of tech industry employees are women, even though some of the first pioneers in computing were women (like Admiral Grace Hopper, herself). I've walked into so many rooms where I am one of few women. I've walked into even more where I am the ONLY woman. I've also heard a lot of people trying to justify the massive amount of male attendees by saying, The job market is really tough right now. Now, imagine how tough it is for a woman or NB person just fighting to get a spot at the table and work 3x harder than their co-workers just to prove they weren't a diversity hire. I've also heard people say GHC is unfair and unequal because it favors women. The reality is that people tend to hire people who resonate with them, and unfortunately, most of the tech industry is still men. We need opportunities like GHC so companies will hire candidates with the INTENTION of leveling the playing field. My final remarks on this reflection of my experience: To the men who attended GHC, you have dropped your ethics and morals just for the chance to get a job. You've hit a new kind of low. To the girls who attended GHC with stars in their eyes and high hopes, I am so sorry that this dream turned into a nightmare. I am sorry your safe space was invaded and violated. But remember that we are stronger together, and at this time, it's more important than ever that we stand together. I know many women and NB individuals from GHC are hesitant and even scared to speak out about what happened. They feel their voices will not be heard. So I will use my platform to amplify their voices and ensure that we ARE heard. Activate to view larger image,"}]}

In previous generations, having a 2nd job was only something someone did if they needed the money or the salary from their day job wasn't cutting it. But Gen Z is totally changing that narrative! For some Gen Zs, starting a side hustle IS motivated by need, but we have so many more reasons than just finances. My main side hustle, as you can probably guess, is content creation. I did not start creating content with the intention of making money from it. Initially, it was simply a hobby and a creative outlet. But as it grew, my content creation became so much more. It became a way for me to advance my career as a Product Manager, build a portfolio of work [that was completely unrelated to my day job ], receive unique opportunities (speaking engagements, press, etc.), and eventually, make an income. It's also a key piece of my portfolio career (a term coined by Meagan Loyst ). Like many other Gen Zs, my identity and existence aren't tied to my job, and we've figured out that one job can't fulfill us completely ~ and that's okay!! That's why we side hustle and build portfolio careers! But going back to the making money from side hustles bit, Gen Zs build side hustles for multiple reasons related to finance. We've watched our friends, colleagues, and classmates get laid off at the slightest turn of the economy, and in this day and age, job security is kind of a mythical creature; having a side hustle can alleviate some of the stress from that lack of job security. Personally, I like having income from a side hustle because I never want to feel tied to a job just because I need the paycheck. If a job ever turns toxic or isn't fulfilling, I wouldn't want to stay just for the money. Having income from a side hustle gives you that freedom of choice. Moreover, I think this just goes to show that the stereotype about Gen Zs being lazy is just that ~ a stereotype. hashtag#SideHustle hashtag#GenZ hashtag#LITrendingTopics hashtag#FutureOfWork"}]}

First off, I want to express how grateful I am to have had the opportunity to be an official media partner for Grace Hopper Celebration . Having an official media badge and running around creating content all week was so much fun, and I am so happy to have played a part in amplifying the mission and message of AnitaB.org. And even though the original purpose of this conference was content creation and professional development, it was so much more than that, thanks to my wonderful friends, old and new. To my long-time internet friends/Linked[In]fluencer crew, you made my GHC experience that much more special, and I am so happy I finally got to meet all of you in person!! From watching Manny get recognized in his Where's Waldo? cosplay, taking candid videos for Skyler's vlog, eating lunch on the steps outside the expo hall, to having a week-long sleepover with my LinkedIn soul sister, Jahnavi, I will forever treasure these memories.  (+Xue Hua, Ly Na Nguyen) To my new friends, thank you for being a part of my conference experience, and I'm so grateful to have been a part of yours!!  Jenny, Angelina, Diana, Shiny And, of course, I'm super thankful for the opportunity to network with some amazing companies, and an extra big thank you to all of the wonderful GHC recruitment/representative teams of Two Sigma, Google, The D. E. Shaw Group, Wayfair, CodePath, Apple, and Northrop Grumman, for taking a few minutes to star in my content!! Last, but most certainly not least, thank you to my friends, colleagues, and communities (Girls Who Code, Kode With Klossy, Gen She) for making me feel supported throughout this entire conference.

One of the things that was attractive to me was a booming startup ecosystem. Unfortunately, COVID-19 really brought the ecosystem to a screeching halt, and by the time I got here (Fall 2020), the ecosystem was dormant (not dead, just dormant). I always knew I wanted to do something to try and re-awaken the ecosystem or do something to impact it. Earlier this year, I discovered VC as a career path, and I realized that maybe this was the way I could be the change I wanted to see in my community. So I started on my mission, took VC 101 with Meagan Loyst to learn the basics, got into GenZScouts to double down on what I'd learned, and became a scout for Soma to apply my skills at one of the biggest early-stage firms in the world. Now, I'm taking it a step further. With Venturous, my goal is to build the Reno-Tahoe startup ecosystem, connect founders to funders (VCs), and serve underrepresented and overlooked communities (in both startups and VC). So let's do this!  If you're an ecosystem builder, please message me or email me; I'd love to chat about how we can work together and discuss potential synergies!  If you're a VC and looking for dealflow, send me a DM; I might be able to hook you up.   Regardless of your location, if you're building something awesome in the technology space or at the intersection of technology and looking to raise, send me a DM! I'd love to talk and see if we can get you funded!  And real quick, a special shout-out and thank you to Haley Zapolski (Zap) and Neil Granberry for providing this incredible opportunity to Cohort 2 and for giving us scouts a platform to be catalysts in our respective startup ecosystems. hashtag#venturecapital hashtag#vc hashtag#startups hashtag#startupecosystem hashtag#startupfunding"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Job hunting sucks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's no sugar-coating it. Recently, I went through an interview process with four rounds of interviews. I seriously thought I had a good shot of getting the role. I completed my last round but hadn't heard anything for two weeks. So I followed up with the recruitment manager, asking if I needed to complete any more steps for my application. Then, I got the dreaded After careful consideration, we are moving forward with other candidates email and another generic-sounding email (though from an actual person) telling me to check my email and that you had a great background, but we're moving forward with other candidates. Words cannot describe the frustration that I feel. If I have a great background, why didn't I get the role? And did we really need to go through 4 interview rounds and 6 hours of prep time to come to that conclusion? Sure, the rejection hurts. But what frustrates me is a lack of feedback and even empathy. But I'm not just here to rant. Out of the 200+ applications and hiring processes I've been through, there were 2 in particular (both rejections), but still had a pleasant and personable hiring process. Here are 3 key takeaways from that process that I HOPE more recruiters and hiring managers will put into practice ~  Please take just 5-10 minutes to give us feedback. If you have 5 minutes left in an interview or a candidate follows up after a rejection, please take the time to provide feedback. In 2021, one recruiter took the time to give me feedback on my resume during my interview despite the fact that I got rejected for the role. She probably doesn't know this, but she might've changed my entire career trajectory with that feedback.  Provide your candidates updates and have transparency in the process. Last year, I went through a recruitment process for an internship with an amazing recruiter, and she sent me updates at least once a week, if not twice. If she didn't have an update on my application, she'd send me prep resources for the next round or offer a call to check in and see how I was doing. And as soon as she knew the next steps, she'd email me.  Don't just send the auto-reject template email if they've invested significant time into the process. I totally understand getting auto-rejection emails after submitting an initial application but after four interviews? Seriously? With the recruiter I previously mentioned, I ended up getting rejected for the role. But rather than sending a template generic email, she called me to talk it over with me, provide feedback, and offer help in the future. Because of how I was treated in these processes, I still think very highly of these companies and I would apply again in a heartbeat if the occasion arose. And yet, so many companies are dumbfounded when it comes to employer branding and what they can do to attract more talent. It's not rocket science ~ start with creating recruitment processes that don't dehumanize candidates."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to Find, Apply for, and Manage Internships "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It occurred to me recently that no one taught me how to apply for internships or full-time jobs. There was no Career 101 or Internships 101 (though there should be). So I'm going to get back to basics today and giving a real-life tutorial on how to find, apply for, and manage internships!  Establish your targets. Your academic major or field of study does not necessarily determine the type of roles you'll be applying for. Plus, you might qualify for several different roles! For example, if you're a CS major, you could apply for software engineering, product management, or systems engineering roles. If you're a business-related major, you could aim for investment banking, consulting, or corporate finance roles.  Prepare your materials. Your materials will be your resume, cover letter, and, if applicable, portfolio. As an early career professional, it's worth putting in a considerable amount of time and effort on these things. Without a network or an established personal brand, these are what will get your foot in the door. (: If you need somewhere to start, steal the resume and cover letter that landed me eight interviews as a freshman  https://lnkd.in/gpKbdyTK)  Find some internships to apply for. There are a few different places to find internships. Personally, my favorite job board is LinkedIn Jobs, but Glassdoor, Chegg Inc. Internships, Indeed, Handshake, and Untapped are all great places to find internships. You can also get a little creative! Subscribe to newsletters like mine (hehe, shameless self-plug  https://lnkd.in/gWCqgE3x), iykyk.careers (https://lnkd.in/giauuuxa), and for the tech girlies, Gen She (https://lnkd.in/g7SHxdnr).  Keep track of everything. I applied to 150 internships as a freshman and I would've lost my mind if I hadn't systemized the way that I kept track of them. You can use several different tools to do this, but I prefer Google Sheets & Notion. Create a tracker with companies, job titles, application links, check boxes, due dates, and status to track each internship you apply for.  Level up your applications with automation & AI. Once you start applying, you will realize that job hunting is a very repetitive and tedious process. It's also incredibly time-consuming. So use the technology that's out there to your advantage, like Simplify (auto-fill job applications) or Resume Worded (analyze your resume with AI) [not sponsored]. hashtag#internships hashtag#earlycareers hashtag#summerinternship hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#jobsearchtips"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm a senior in college, and I'm having an existential crisis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, not really. But I am pretty uncertain of what I'll do in 8 months when I graduate. It's not that I'm clueless. I've just realized that there are more opportunities out there than I previously considered, and it turns out [surprise] that I'm passionate about several different things! It's perfectly okay to not have a perfectly flushed-out roadmap for the rest of your life when you're 20-24 years old. But on the flip side of that same coin, you should try to prepare as best as you can. My favorite keyword for this ~ exploration. So, entering my senior year, here are the 5 things that I would do/do better/have done differently to be as career-ready as possible ahead of graduation: [Remember: the theme is explore, explore, explore]  Be creative with your education. You might think you know what you want to major in, but things can change. If you can, take classes outside your primary major; strive for a somewhat interdisciplinary education. I supplemented Computer science classes with business, entrepreneurship, and math classes.  Travel a little bit! You don't have to be Mr. or Mrs. Worldwide. Just get out of your little bubble and visit places you've always wanted to. Why? It's a good way to figure out if and where you want to move and continue your career after college + if that place has opportunities in your field.  Get experience at different-sized companies. Working at a startup is VASTLY different than working at a medium-sized or Fortune 100 company. I've worked at two startups, one small venture fund, and one Fortune 100. Each experience taught me something new and helped me figure out which environment I prefer.  Get experience doing different job functions. Chances are, with your field of study, you can qualify for multiple different types of jobs. For example, if you're a CS major, you could do SWE, Systems Engineering, Backend, Data Science, or Product Management. Try different roles to see what you like and what comes naturally to you.  Get experience doing stuff outside of your lane or comfort zone. Never in my life did I think that I'd be doing strategy consulting, venture capital, or content creation with a Computer science and engineering background, but here we are. Do stuff that's outside of your comfort zone! hashtag#BackToSchool hashtag#earlycareers hashtag#newgrad hashtag#students hashtag#LITrendingTopics"}]}

Product101 is a product fellowship program built to provide a pathway and early introduction to product management for undergraduate students.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "IDK how many times I have to say it, but PAY YOUR INTERNS."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I got these two job alerts in the past weekend, and I'm both confused and agitated. If a role is high priority, why is it unpaid , like please make it make sense. That being said, the reality is that we're in a time where a lot of students are desperate, and my guess is we're going to see more and more employers exploiting students' positions… oh sorry, I meant to say offering unpaid internships. So, to both students/aspiring interns and college career centers, please keep these things in mind: Students who have done unpaid internships are only 1.8% more likely to land a full-time job than students who have never done internships (no internship - 35.2%, unpaid internship - 37%) [Source: The Atlantic/NACE]. As of 2022, the median starting salary for students who did paid internships was $20k higher than students who did unpaid internships [Source: State Press/NACE]. And for the students, here's what you should do, if you're contemplating an unpaid internship ~ Keep looking. I was offered an unpaid internship as a freshman, but something didn't feel right about it. So I kept looking, and I found not 1, not 2, but 5 different employers who were willing to pay me as an intern. If you're just going for the experience, take a look at micro-internships on sites like Parker Dewey. They're typically shorter commitments, but you get industry experience AND you get paid [+they're offered year-round, not just during summer]. Look into grants/programs at your school. Most institutions of higher education offer grants, stipends, etc. to students who are being offered unpaid or low-paid internships. (Ex: UNR, Pack Internship Grant Program, $16/hr for 120 hours of work). And to the employers: DO BETTER"}]}

And just like that, the 7th semester is over!!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I completed my last final exam of the semester and I am so relieved. That s**t was so stressful. But now that it's over, I can reflect on all the cool, amazing, and fun things that happened this semester! So here's my 7th semester wrapped! Cool stuff I learened about and did in school: Learned how to do proformas, cashflow statements & business planning in my Applied Entrepreneurship class ↳ Wrote an NLP algorithm to analyze the overlap between my LinkedIn skills section and the jobs I've applied to (data science project) ↳ Learned how K-Means, KNN, PCA, and Perceptron algorithms work in my Machine Learning class ↳ Began work on training an AI model & building an AI application in my Senior Projects class. Stuff I accomplished:  Got 2 six-figure full-time PM job offers for after graduation  ↳ Got featured in NPR & Fast Company  ↳ Won 2nd place at my first-ever business pitch competition ↳ Got selected to be a Media Partner for AnitaB.org, covering GHC23 ↳ Secured and did 8 speaking engagements & 7 brand partnerships ↳ Got featured on a Times Square Billboard for the 3rd time ↳ Completed my 6th internship with The Walt Disney Company ↳ Taught & mentored 5 startup founders through the gener8tor Reno-Tahoe ↳ Got accepted to and completed the Girls Who Code Fall Leadership Academy. Memories: Attending GHC and meeting my LinkedIn/internet besties, Disney fam, and the WayUp team in person ↳ Going to Disney World for the 1st time [as a cast member] and bringing my LinkedIn soul sister, Jahnavi ↳ Getting recognized from LinkedIn at Disneyland (no, seriously) ↳ Celebrating my 1-year anniversary with my boyfriend, Parker (aka my #1 fan) ↳ Celebrating my 21st birthday with my friends & family. Ultimately, I think the most fun part of this semester was balancing being a student and everything else happening in my life. I couldn't count how many times people from my work life said, Sometimes I forget you're a student , when I'd say that I had to run to class or take an exam. NGL, I sometimes felt like Hannah Montana, having the best of both worlds, just a little. And I'm looking forward to more!! I've already got so many plans and things happening behind the scenes for next semester. I can't wait to share them all, but for now, stay tuned... "}]}
