{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to Create Strong Resume Bullet Points"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I cold-applied to 150 internships as a freshman with no referrals and no work experience. Yet, I still managed to land 8 first-round interviews and 3 offers for paid summer internships. I feel like this is sort of a hot take with all of the content on LinkedIn focused around networking [and getting referrals], but like it or not, you still have to have a strong resume to get your foot in the door. More and more companies are putting less and less weight on referrals in an effort to create a more equal playing field, and some companies don't accept referrals for internships AT ALL. So what can you do to better your chances in a sea of ultra-competitive applicants? Make your resume so compelling that the hiring manager has no choice but to give you a shot! One of the best ways to do that is the Google X-Y-Z method. This method is not new or novel; lots of people, especially on LinkedIn, have mentioned or discussed it. But not a lot of people explain exactly how to implement it. So here's how to implement the Google XYZ resume method + real examples I've used! If you want to learn even more about how to craft a compelling resume, I still have 5 spots left open in my 2-hour resume writing masterclass, happening *TOMORROW*. Reserve your spot here ➡️ https://lnkd.in/g74_9gG3 [if the time doesn't work for your schedule, no worries! Register for the class and you'll be sent a recording of the whole class!] The Google XYZ Method: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]. Now let's break it down ~ [X] Start with a past-tense action verb that's appropriate for the experience ex. Achieved, Improved, Launched, Transformed, Designed, Built, etc. [X] Name the task at hand ~ designed a web-based innovation management platfor (design example), built a native iOS mobile application that connected the user (engineering example), led a team to deliver a prototype and pitch deck to define a minimum viable product (product example). [Y] Quantify the impact your accomplishment had ~ ...thereby saving ET $49,000/year on software outsourcing (cost impact), ...pilot for 300+ participants, (customer impact), ...resulted in $8.7k in sales (revenue impact). [Z] Elaborate on how you did the task and what skills it took to do it ~ ...[in order] to define a minimum viable product, demonstrate user flows, and outline product KPIs (product example), to test the efficacy of process by evaluating a previously-identified efficiency opportunity against the process (process engineering example).

Last year, it was 20 lessons, so this year, I'm continuing the tradition with 21!!! But I'm adding a twist this year! This whole week, I will be posting 21-themed things, and I'm gonna get real personal 😂 [along with the regular content, of course 🫶]. So here are 21 lessons I've learned from year 21: 5 𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘐'𝘷𝘦 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘛𝘪𝘮𝘦, 𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘺 & 𝘎𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘖𝘭𝘥𝘦𝘳 (1) Make more time for the people who want to pour into you. (2) You have to protect your time & your peace because no one else will. (3) Be picky & intentional with who you spend your time with & how you spend it. (4) Maturing is realizing what you're actually worth and enforcing that worth. (5) Getting older is appreciating the mundane things like 9 hours of sleep, home-cooked healthy meals, and being able to spend >30 min in the gym. 5 𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘐'𝘷𝘦 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘗𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘗𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦 (1) People are generally more forgiving and nicer than you assume. (2) Time & distance don't necessarily matter when it's the right people. (Translation: I love my LinkedIn/internet besties!!] (3) The right partner can make all the difference. (4) Having & craving a smaller circle is perfectly normal and okay. (5) You don't have to deal with toxic people. F**k 'em. 5 𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘐'𝘷𝘦 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘓𝘪𝘧𝘦 (1) Decisions aren't permanent. You can change your mind and pivot. (2) Pave your own path. Your journey & timeline are yours and yours alone. (3) You HAVE to get really uncomfortable if you want to improve. (4) Things/situations are only as stressful as YOU make them. (5) You will outgrow things, places, and people, and that's okay. 5 𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘐'𝘷𝘦 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘔𝘺𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘧 + 𝘔𝘺 𝘉𝘰𝘯𝘶𝘴 #21 (1) My three non-negotiables [with opportunities] are ethics, passion & compensation (feeling valued). (2) Being impulsive or going with your gut isn't always a bad thing. (3) I am NOT superhuman, and I should probably be more forgiving of myself. 😂 (4) Value isn't just what you have to give or offer, it's also who YOU are. (5) I will always follow through on a commitment or a promise, even when it makes me feel like s**t. (Bonus #21) I don't hold grudges, but if you burn a bridge with me, don't ask me for career help, clout, collabs, or really anything else. I will forgive, but I will never f***ing forget. 💅 That’s my 21 lessons for this year, stay tuned for “21 People I’m Grateful for in my LinkedIn Journey,” “21 Amazing, Incredible, Exceptional Moments,” “21 Hopes, Goals, Dreams for year 22,” “21 crazy, way-too-personal stories” (newsletter article), and “21 Things I’m Proud of.” 🥳"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "breakdown of the 5 key elements of my resume & why each one is so important"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I wrote a resume that got me SWE intern interviews at TikTok, Accenture, Ford, Analog Devices (ADI), SiriusXM, three offers from startups and offers from Medidata [a Fortune Future 50], SAP, and Disney **as a freshman**. Here is a breakdown of the 5 key elements of my resume & why each one is so important: ✅ Header - email, phone number, LinkedIn link, GitHub link, and portfolio website link. Include your contact info since the hiring team needs to know how to contact you. Include your LinkedIn, GitHub, and portfolio to give the hiring team a comprehensive look at who you are and what makes you perfect for the job. ✅ Education - relevant coursework and activities/organizations. Some internships, like Microsoft Explore, require a certain level of coursework (ex. Calculus I, Intro to CS). Other companies may expect you to have completed higher-level coursework, like DSA. Showing involvement in on-campus organizations can show off non-work interests or your dedication to a specific niche (ex. Cybersecurity, Product). ✅ Skills - professional skills, software, and programming languages. Almost any job requires you to have the first two, and most tech jobs require all three. Professional skills generally refer to industry- or role-related skills (ex. project management), and software skills refer to software tools you know how to use (ex. Asana, Jira, Confluence). ✅ Technical Experience - Notice that I didn't say work experience 👀 ~ that's because I didn't have any. I made do with what I had which was my experience at Berkeley's PUF Immersion program, Girls Who Code's SIP, and Kode with Klossy's Web Dev camp. I didn't necessarily have work experience, but I demonstrated both knowledge and applied experience in the area I was trying to break into (SWE). ✅ Projects ~ saved the best for last! Projects are not only a way to show off your technical skills but also to show initiative in doing things outside of academics. Two of my projects from my freshman year were an iOS mobile app and a hackathon project that got 2nd place. 🧠 Want to write a killer resume that gets you offers like mine did?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I did my first startup pitch competition & I got 2nd place!! 🥳🥈"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "About a week ago, I made a very last-minute decision to enter the 1st annual LaunchNevada Pitch Competition. Yesterday, I was SO nervous 😅. My stomach was in knots for hours beforehand, and I couldn't even get my heart rate down until *right before* it was my turn to pitch. Nerves aside, I still gave a pitch that I'm pretty proud of and was good enough to get 2nd place (+a $1,000 prize 😱). I watched all of the other pitches, and based on those + mine, here are a few key tips/observations to win/place at a pitch competition: 1️⃣ Keep your presentation on time! If you go over your given time limit, it looks like you didn't rehearse, and makes you look unprepared. Plus, there is nothing worse/more embarrassing than getting hard-stopped by the judges halfway through your slides. 2️⃣ Keep your deck small. You should be able to convey your concept in <10 slides. The best pitches are typically around 5-6 slides. A good rule of thumb is to make your deck 1/2 as many slides as you have minutes [10 minutes = 5 slides]. 3️⃣ Observe other pitches if you can. You can't always control the order in which you go; I went 10th out of 11 last night, and that was by luck of the draw [literally, we drew numbers]. But if you pay attention to the other pitches, you can learn from their mistakes and even pre-empt the types of questions the judges might ask. 4️⃣ BFFR ~ Be realistic w/ your numbers [market size, projections, etc.]. No judge wants to see that you have an idea for a local coffee shop and claim to have a $150B total addressable market. In addition, no judge wants to see you have $10M revenue projections in your first year when you don't even have a flushed-out product. The Q&A is everything. TBH, I think pitch competition scoring is *heavily* influenced by how the pitcher handles the Q&A. The judges will ask about things that you didn't cover in your presentation or try to poke holes in it. Q&A Hack: If you have a large deck you can't get through in your time limit, keep the additional slides after your conclusion slide as Appenices and refer to them as needed in your Q&A. It's okay to admit you don't know or don't have an answer. The worst mistake I saw someone make in their Q&A was to try to give a BS answer about a technical topic that was not their core competency. Don't try to smoke & mirror the judges; they will call you on your BS. Overall, this was a fun and fantastic learning experience! Special thanks to the University of Nevada, Reno College of Business for organizing this event, thank you to the judges (Matt Westfield, Chris Yount, Dawson Lamb) for taking the time to listen to our pitches and give us feedback, and thank you to my support group/fan club (boyfriend, Parker + one of my besties, Kayla) for coming to cheer me on. And congratulations to the other prize winners of the night! hashtag#startups hashtag#pitchcompetition hashtag#pitch hashtag#vc hashtag#enterpreneurship"}]}
