Yet, I still managed to land 8 first-round interviews and 3 offers for paid summer internships. I feel like this is sort of a hot take with all of the content on LinkedIn focused around networking [and getting referrals], but like it or not, you still have to have a strong resume to get your foot in the door. More and more companies are putting less and less weight on referrals in an effort to create a more equal playing field, and some companies don't accept referrals for internships AT ALL. So what can you do to better your chances in a sea of ultra-competitive applicants? Make your resume so compelling that the hiring manager has no choice but to give you a shot! One of the best ways to do that is the Google X-Y-Z method. This method is not new or novel; lots of people, especially on LinkedIn, have mentioned or discussed it. But not a lot of people explain exactly how to implement it. So here's how to implement the Google XYZ resume method + real examples I've used! If you want to learn even more about how to craft a compelling resume, I still have 5 spots left open in my 2-hour resume writing masterclass, happening *TOMORROW*. Reserve your spot here ➡️ https://lnkd.in/g74_9gG3 [if the time doesn't work for your schedule, no worries! Register for the class and you'll be sent a recording of the whole class!] The Google XYZ Method: Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]. Now let's break it down ~ [X] Start with a past-tense action verb that's appropriate for the experience ex. Achieved, Improved, Launched, Transformed, Designed, Built, etc. [X] Name the task at hand ~ designed a web-based innovation management platfor (design example), built a native iOS mobile application that connected the user (engineering example), led a team to deliver a prototype and pitch deck to define a minimum viable product (product example). [Y] Quantify the impact your accomplishment had ~ ...thereby saving ET $49,000/year on software outsourcing (cost impact), ...pilot for 300+ participants, (customer impact), ...resulted in $8.7k in sales (revenue impact). [Z] Elaborate on how you did the task and what skills it took to do it ~ ...[in order] to define a minimum viable product, demonstrate user flows, and outline product KPIs (product example), to test the efficacy of process by evaluating a previously-identified efficiency opportunity against the process (process engineering example).
