So, how on earth did I land 3 solid offers despite being late to the game and having a less-than-ideal background? It was a learning process, that's for sure. After my first 75 applications, I had only landed 2 interviews and didn't get either offer. I knew I needed to do something differently, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I got lucky. One of the recruiters from the 2 interviews gave some very polite but constructive feedback on my resume during my interview. On one hand, I was devastated because I knew my resume wouldn't get me the job; but on the other hand, I was so grateful because I never would've known the mistakes I was making if it wasn't for her feedback. These are the 3 major mistakes I made with my resume:  Focusing too much on academics rather than applied experience.  Not including a projects section/portfolio.  Including irrelevant sections. (ex. scholarships, leadership exp.) The major theme that emerged from our conversation was that employers cared about showing and demonstrating the skills you claimed to have via work experience or project experience if you didn't have any work experience. Here's how you can avoid the mistakes I made, using Teal's AI Resume Builder ~  You should keep your resume to one page, so only check the boxes of the minimum relevant sections: for a SWE intern example, this would be Work Experience, Education, Projects, and Skills.  Your most dense sections should be either Work Experience or Projects, depending on what stage of your career you're in. To optimize these, use the \"Enhance with AI\" pen button to make your bullet points robust and impactful. If you're starting from scratch, use the \"Write with AI\" button to create specific bullet points with strong action verbs and quantifying metrics.  Forgo sections like \"Leadership Experience,\" Scholarships, and anything that's not hyper-relevant to the position you're applying for. If you're currently in school & still want to include these things, make them bullet points underneath your Education section. You can write this using the text box that says \"Additional Information\" under Education. After implementing that feedback, I went from landing 2 interviews to landing 7!! And 3 of those 7 turned into offers! So don't make the same mistakes I did; skip those first crappy 75 applications and get to the ones that will land you interviews and offers by using Teal's AI Resume Builder!

Four years ago, I didn't get accepted into either of these schools ????. Mind you, I only applied to one of those 2 (Harvard), but honestly, I didn't have the stats to make it into these elite schools. I couldn't even get into public schools in my own state (University of California system). ???????? I wasn't a bad high school student. I had a 32 ACT, a 4.3 GPA, and I graduated 10th out of ~1200 in my class. But I didn't do internships or research, make Team USA in a sport, start a non-profit, or any other typical outstanding achievement you'd see on a college application. Despite that, I experienced things that shaped me and prepared me for my career and life in a way I never could have predicted. I battled depression for four years and recovered throughout my junior & senior years of high school; this gave me the resilience and optimism that helped me not only survive but thrive during COVID-19. I skated for 16 years and competed for 8, but never made Team USA or qualified for nationals. But it gave me my relentlessness and taught me delayed gratification. I made a contrarian decision with where I chose to go to school and caught a lot of flack for it. But this taught me that you have to make decisions for yourself because it's your life and your journey, no one else's. I competed in pageants to improve my public speaking abilities and people told me that it took away from my intelligence & credibility; yet, here I am, delivering workshops and keynotes at Top 20 universities, like Harvard & UPenn. The takeaway here is ~ stop looking to the left and to the right, comparing other people's journey to your own. Who cares if you didn't get into the top 20 school? Who cares if you didn't get the FAANG internship? You don't have to follow a roadmap someone else created in order to achieve success. You will pave a path that is uniquely yours, and no one can copy you or take it away from you. ???? ???? Want me to come speak at your school, org, company, or event?

NOT knowing how to show \"out-of-the-box\" experience ex. externships, fellowships, competitions, case studies, consulting club projects, etc.  NOT formatting their resume in a way that can be read by an ATS (or any parsing program) Don't blame yourself for these mistakes, though!

I'll be honest; as a senior in high school, I applied to 4 Ivy League schools and got rejected from all 4. So the idea of speaking at these types of schools was beyond my wildest imagination. I was \"just\" the kid from a low-ranked, public state university. Until suddenly, I wasn't, thanks to LinkedIn and the platform it provided. Now, as a passionate user of the platform (AND a LinkedIn Top Voice \"Next Gen\"), it brought me so much joy to teach my \"Leveraging LinkedIn for your Career & Personal Brand\" workshop to the students of UPenn Reach!

I had a BLAST at Harvard University this last weekend, speaking at the 2024 Harvard WECode: Women Engineers Code Conference AND a private event for Harvard Undergraduate Data Analytics Group (HDAG)! Kicking off the weekend on Saturday, we attended WECode in the morning, watched an inspiring opening keynote by Dr. Elizabeth Mynatt and attended an insightful resume workshop by the incredible Xue Hua! After that, Skyler and I ran over to the main Harvard campus to set up our workshop in Harvard Hall, where we gave our LinkedIn & Personal Branding workshop to the brilliant members of the Harvard Data Analytics Group! Sunday comes around, and it's workshop day!!! I'll be honest ~ I slept in a bit as I was recovering from some not-so-great jet lag, so we didn't arrive at our workshop room until 5 minutes before. Skyler & I were not prepared for the sight that met our eyes... You guys PACKED THE HOUSE for \"How to LinkedIn like a GIRLBOSS!\" Our workshop room was over capacity! We heard from a few attendees that they arrived an HOUR early to grab seats for our event. Some attendees sat in the aisles, against the back wall, and even outside the glass wall just to get a glimpse of the magic! And justifiably so! In our workshop, we held a little challenge for our attendees. We challenged our attendees to write a LinkedIn post about their workshop experience, using the tips, tricks, and \"viral LinkedIn post formula\" that we taught them. And they KILLED this challenge!! FORTY of our attendees (that we counted) took part in our challenge, and TEN of them even went semi-viral/viral! A special shoutout goes to Michelle, who took everything we taught and implemented it beautifully, putting out a post that received over 1,000 likes/reactions!! This weekend was everything I had dreamed it to be and more, and I will never forget it. Thank you so, so much to the Harvard WEcode board (w/ a special shoutout to Kyra & Sein, the Directors of Programming) for giving us a platform to speak and putting on such a fantastic and wonderful event! Thank you to everyone who came to our workshop, took part in our challenge, and said hi to me and Skyler! Until next year, Harvard ????... P.S.
