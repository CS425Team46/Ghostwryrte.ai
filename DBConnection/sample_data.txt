🚨 Summer Internships 2024 - Software Engineering 🚨

Once upon a time, I thought I would be a software engineer for the entirety of my career. Obviously, that was before a lot of career exploration and many pivots to come 😂. 

Nonetheless, I am a Computer Science major [graduating in the Spring 😆], and Software Engineering is one of the more popular and common career paths to take as a CS major. 

Software engineering is a fantastic [and lucrative] career path, but it can be incredibly challenging to break into. The best way in, IMO, is internships, and if there's anything the current job market is teaching us, it's that return offers are EVERYTHING. So, with that, here's a fresh roundup of Summer '24 Software Engineering internship opportunities!
